Often this symbol can be found online by accounts that either cherry-pick, misconstrue, or falsify data in order to ""prove"" causation between minorities and higher levels of crime to ""demonstrate"" the false and racist view that minorities are inherently more violent than white people. The 13 is a reference to the percentage of Black people in the US population. ""50"" or ""52"" is a reference to the alleged percentage of all murders committed in the US by African Americans, while ""90"" is a reference to the alleged percentage of violent interracial crime.13/51', '1488 is one of the most important numerical signifiers in the neo-Nazi world. Neo-Nazis and other white supremacists are fond of using numeric symbols to signify their beliefs. Here, the number 8 refers to the eighth number of the alphabet, H, and thus ""HH"" stands for ""Heil Hitler."" The “14”  refers to the ""14 words,"" a white supremacist slogan first penned by deceased terrorist David Lane of the violent white supremacist group The Order. The 14 Words are: ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.""1488', '""Six Gorillion"" is a derogatory term used by antisemites, particularly associated with the alt-right faction of white supremacists. It mocks the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust and perpetuates a harmful narrative that questions the authenticity of the Nazi genocide. The term implies that Jews exaggerate the Holocaust\'s impact and use it as a shield to deflect criticism. This antisemitic expression is often utilized in memes to deny, distort, or ridicule the Holocaust and the associated culture of remembrance. The variant ""Muh Six Gorillion"" includes the slang term ""muh,"" suggesting whining or complaining, insinuating that Jews are accused of excessively referencing the Holocaust to evade criticism. This usage is akin to the antisemitic phrase ""Muh Holocaust.""6 Gorillion']"

The Boogaloo flag consists of 13 stripes in the style of the American flag, with 12 black and white stripes, and a single stripe in the center in the style of Hawaiian shirts, a meme within the Boogaloo movement. In Place of the 50 stars of the American flag, the Boogaloo has an igloo, which, according to members, sounds similar to ""Boogaloo,"" and is also used as a meme.Boogaloo Movement flags', 'Pepe the Frog is a cartoon character and Internet meme created by cartoonist Matt Furie, for a web comic ""Boy\'s Club"" in 2005. The image was co-opted by racists around 2015 and became one of the most widely shared images online of members of the ""alt-right,"" essentially racists and white supremacists. The image was manipulated in various ways by extremists and was spread through 4chan and other forums used by far-right extremists, including the now banned subreddit ""r/TheDonald."" Furie has expressed his dismay at Pepe being used as a hate symbol and has sued organizations for doing so.Pepe the Frog', 'The flag of the fake country of Kekistan is a popular far-right meme used by members of the ""alt-right,"" particularly during the early years of the Trump presidency, and popularized by the user Sargon of Akkad. It is a take on a German Imperial flag where stylized letter Ks replace the swastika, and the 4chan logo replaces the iron cross. Red is also traded for Green. The flag emerged out of the satirical online religion, The Cult of Kek. This mock religion pretends to worship the ancient Egyptian god Kek, whose modern prophet is Pepe the Frog.  Adherents often espouse other far-right memes such as Pepe the Frog in generally juvenile online posts. The use of such ironic memes signals to others one\'s adherence to far-right and racist beliefs.Kekistan Flag']"
2,2,6,2_term_lgbtq_white_racist,"['term', 'lgbtq', 'white', 'racist', 'people', 'slur', 'immigration', 'groomer', 'guy', 'community']","['""Jogger"" is a racist term when used in online forums such as 4chan. Its use this way started around early 2020 as a replacement for the n-word. The term was coined following the killing by police in Georgia of American Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed Black man, who was jogging at the time of his death. Afterwards, racist 4chan users appropriated the term and popularized it online as a new racist slur.Jogger', '""Cuck"", originating from the term ""cuckhold,"" is a racist and misogynist pejorative used by white supremacist individuals to imply that embracing liberal values related to immigration, women\'s rights, etc., is on par with being weak. It is derived from cuckold, which means have been conned into raising another person\'s children or allowing someone else to have sex with one\'s wife or significant other. The racist connotations come when the topic of immigration is introduced; racists often refer to individuals that are open to the idea of non-white immigration as ""cucks"" in an effort to portray immigrants as being invasive and threatening to the ""purity"" of white women and the white gene pool. The term ""cuckservative"" was created specifically to refer to conservatives perceived to be too open to immigration and not sympathetic to white nationalist causes.Cuck', '""Groomer"" is a slur used against LGBTQ+ people, especially trans individuals, and those who support LGBTQ+ rights. The term disparages the sharing of factual information about LGBTQ+ issues with children as actually propaganda intended to ""recruit"" children into pedophilia or a ""gay lifestyle."" The term is clearly anti-LGBTQ+, simply intended to demonize the entire community. The term has become widely adopted by the far right in countries where ""culture war"" issues have shifted towards attacking the LGBTQ+ community, drag show story hours and pro-trans events. In the United States, far-right groups such as the ""Gays Against Groomers"" and Project 171 (standing for ""Anti-Groomer Action"") have adopted the term in the official name of their organizations. Generally, groomers can be found online as a slur for LGBTQ+ people.Groomer']"

Originally intending to achieve global sustainable development by the year 2000, the ""21"" in Agenda 21 reflects the target of the 21st century. The initiative encourages local, national, and global voluntary actions by the UN, multilateral organizations, and individual governments. However, various conspiracy theories have emerged regarding Agenda 21, particularly among American antigovernment and militia organizations and far-right activists. The ""Agenda 21"" conspiracy theory is a baseless and widely debunked narrative that falsely claims a secret global plot to establish a New World Order and control individuals\' lives through environmental regulations. The right-wing John Birch Society labeled it as a disguised plot to curtail individual freedom and establish a one-world government. Some activists, including elements of the American Tea Party movement, propagated the theory that Agenda 21 aimed to undermine property rights, U.S. sovereignty, or coerce citizens into relocating to urban areas. Far-right American media personality Glenn Beck went further, warning of a ""seditious"" conspiracy to reduce the world population by 85 percent, leading to global government control and a dystopian police state, as detailed in his co-authored 2012 Agenda 21.Agenda 21', '""I will not eat the bugs"" is a phrase originally coined by believers of the ""Great Reset"" conspiracy theory.
