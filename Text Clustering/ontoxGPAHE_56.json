It mocks the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust and perpetuates a harmful narrative that questions the authenticity of the Nazi genocide. The term implies that Jews exaggerate the Holocaust's impact and use it as a shield to deflect criticism. This antisemitic expression is often utilized in memes to deny, distort, or ridicule the Holocaust and the associated culture of remembrance. The variant \"Muh Six Gorillion\" includes the slang term \"muh,\" suggesting whining or complaining, insinuating that Jews are accused of excessively referencing the Holocaust to evade criticism. This usage is akin to the antisemitic phrase \"Muh Holocaust.\"",

The slogan laments that only six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust, implying that an even more deadly genocide would have been preferable. Obviously horrifically antisemitic and celebrating genocide, the term has found widespread acceptance among white supremacists and was featured on t-shirts worn by a member of the Proud Boys.",

Often this symbol can be found online by accounts that either cherry-pick, misconstrue, or falsify data in order to \"prove\" causation between minorities and higher levels of crime to \"demonstrate\" the false and racist view that minorities are inherently more violent than white people. The 13 is a reference to the percentage of Black people in the US population. \"50\" or \"52\" is a reference to the alleged percentage of all murders committed in the US by African Americans, while \"90\" is a reference to the alleged percentage of violent interracial crime.",

        "Description": "Agenda 21 is a non-binding action plan established by the United Nations during the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, focusing on creating conditions for sustainable development. Originally intending to achieve global sustainable development by the year 2000, the \"21\" in Agenda 21 reflects the target of the 21st century. The initiative encourages local, national, and global voluntary actions by the UN, multilateral organizations, and individual governments. However, various conspiracy theories have emerged regarding Agenda 21, particularly among American antigovernment and militia organizations and far-right activists. The \"Agenda 21\" conspiracy theory is a baseless and widely debunked narrative that falsely claims a secret global plot to establish a New World Order and control individuals' lives through environmental regulations. The right-wing John Birch Society labeled it as a disguised plot to curtail individual freedom and establish a one-world government. Some activists, including elements of the American Tea Party movement, propagated the theory that Agenda 21 aimed to undermine property rights, U.S. sovereignty, or coerce citizens into relocating to urban areas. Far-right American media personality Glenn Beck went further, warning of a \"seditious\" conspiracy to reduce the world population by 85 percent, leading to global government control and a dystopian police state, as detailed in his co-authored 2012 Agenda 21.",

Other racist proponents argue that tolerance towards immigrants and minorities is equivalent to turning a blind eye, in the name of \"political correctness,\" to the \"truth\" that is minorities' innate tendency to be violent. Another iteration is, \"Diversity is a code word for white genocide.\" The phrase has been used by white supremacists in the US dropping banners from overpasses and placing them on billboards.",

        "Description": "\"Cuck\", originating from the term \"cuckhold,\" is a racist and misogynist pejorative used by white supremacist individuals to imply that embracing liberal values related to immigration, women's rights, etc., is on par with being weak. It is derived from cuckold, which means have been conned into raising another person's children or allowing someone else to have sex with one's wife or significant other. The racist connotations come when the topic of immigration is introduced; racists often refer to individuals that are open to the idea of non-white immigration as \"cucks\" in an effort to portray immigrants as being invasive and threatening to the \"purity\" of white women and the white gene pool. The term \"cuckservative\" was created specifically to refer to conservatives perceived to be too open to immigration and not sympathetic to white nationalist causes.",

        "Description": "The \"cultural enrichment\" meme is a racist caricature of a multicultural society that disparagingly depicts scenarios of violent minorities with mocking claims. The images usually contrast these images with the language that this is how a multicultural society is being \"cultural enriched.\" The idea is to mock multicultural tenants of diversity as bringing violence to societies. These racist memes are very frequently found on social media platforms frequented by white supremacists, such as 4chan. Foreigners and POC are often referred to as \"cultural enrichers\" by the far right as a reference to this meme.",

This meme has become so widespread that it is not exclusively used by racists anymore, so context is key to identifying hateful usage of it.",

The term has become widely adopted by the far right in countries where \"culture war\" issues have shifted towards attacking the LGBTQ+ community, drag show story hours and pro-trans events. In the United States, far-right groups such as the \"Gays Against Groomers\" and Project 171 (standing for \"Anti-Groomer Action\") have adopted the term in the official name of their organizations.

The World Economic Forum's \"Great Reset\" campaign is an economic recovery plan created during the 2020 annual meeting that also sought to address climate-related issues and environmental sustainability. Believers of the \"Great Reset\" conspiracy theory allege that \"global elites\" are set on using stay-at-home orders and other coronavirus pandemic measures as a justification to create a totalitarian world government. \"I will not eat the bugs\" is a phrase the expresses the believers' opposition to what they claim are the global elites' plans to promote the eating of insects as a new sustainable food source.",

Afterwards, racist 4chan users appropriated the term and popularized it online as a new racist slur.",

It is a take on a German Imperial flag where stylized letter Ks replace the swastika, and the 4chan logo replaces the iron cross. Red is also traded for Green. The flag emerged out of the satirical online religion, The Cult of Kek. This mock religion pretends to worship the ancient Egyptian god Kek, whose modern prophet is Pepe the Frog.  Adherents often espouse other far-right memes such as Pepe the Frog in generally juvenile online posts. The use of such ironic memes signals to others one's adherence to far-right and racist beliefs.",

The image was co-opted by racists around 2015 and became one of the most widely shared images online of members of the \"alt-right,\" essentially racists and white supremacists. The image was manipulated in various ways by extremists and was spread through 4chan and other forums used by far-right extremists, including the now banned subreddit \"r/TheDonald.\" Furie has expressed his dismay at Pepe being used as a hate symbol and has sued organizations for doing so.",

        "Description": "\"Where We Go One, We Go All\" (WWG1WGA) is a slogan adopted by the American far right conspiracist movement QAnon, which claims that American (and global) elites have secretly created child sex trafficking rings and drink their blood for adrenochrome, an imaginary substance that grants psychoactive or regenerative benefits depending on the narrative. The phrase originated from a scene in the 1996 movie \"White Squall,\" where the phrase was written on a ship's bell. The phrase was then referenced by the anonymous poster \"Q\" and popularized by QAnon followers. The slogan can often be found on sites frequented by QAnon believers and on flags used by their followers.",

Though it started as a slogan popular among racists, an international organization that calls itself \"White Lives Matter\" eventually emerged. In the US, there have been White Lives Matter rallies and events, most taking place during Trump's presidency. In 2023, a self-described White Lives Matter member was arrested for trying to burn down a church holding an LGBTQ+ event.",

        "Description": "\"You will own nothing and be happy\" is a phrase originally coined by the World Economic Forum's \"Great Reset\" campaign, an economic recovery plan created during the 2020 annual meeting that also sought to address climate-related issues and environmental sustainability. This phrase has since been used by believers of the \"Great Reset\" conspiracy theory to allege that \"global elites\" are set on using stay-at-home orders and other coronavirus pandemic measures as a justification to create a totalitarian world government  and confiscate the people's possessions. Believers in the conspiracy see it leading to a dystopian future.",

The capitalized \"Z\" is often used in Latin script text to signify support for the Russians in the war, while in Russian script, it is used as a replacement for the Russian letter \"\u0437,\" which functionally has the same sound.",
