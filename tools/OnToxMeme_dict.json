Originally intending to achieve global sustainable development by the year 2000, the \"21\" in Agenda 21 reflects the target of the 21st century. The initiative encourages local, national, and global voluntary actions by the UN, multilateral organizations, and individual governments. However, various conspiracy theories have emerged regarding Agenda 21, particularly among American antigovernment and militia organizations and far-right activists. The \"Agenda 21\" conspiracy theory is a baseless and widely debunked narrative that falsely claims a secret global plot to establish a New World Order and control individuals' lives through environmental regulations. The right-wing John Birch Society labeled it as a disguised plot to curtail individual freedom and establish a one-world government. Some activists, including elements of the American Tea Party movement, propagated the theory that Agenda 21 aimed to undermine property rights, U.S. sovereignty, or coerce citizens into relocating to urban areas. Far-right American media personality Glenn Beck went further, warning of a \"seditious\" conspiracy to reduce the world population by 85 percent, leading to global government control and a dystopian police state, as detailed in his co-authored 2012 Agenda 21.",

Their logo consisted of a black swastika with the center removed, on a white circle, and a red background, resembling the original Nazi party flag. Originating from the SA-Sturm Hamburg 8. Mai, the group gained notoriety for its neo-Nazi activities, particularly under the leadership of K\u00fchnen. The ANS merged with Thomas Brehl's group of national activists in 1983 to form the ANS/NA, aligning itself with the ideologies of the NSDAP and SA, including support for antisemitic and racist laws. The organization faced legal consequences, and most of its leadership was imprisoned in 1978/79. On November 24, 1983, the ANS/NA, along with its subsidiary groups, was banned by the Federal Minister of the Interior and dissolved on December 7, 1983. At the time of the ban, it had over 300 mostly young members.",

The ADF symbol consists of the letter \"A,\" formed out of two blue and gray rectangles, and a red curved shape, with the words \"Alliance Defending Freedom, For Faith, For Justice\" beneath. The group has advocated for the recriminalization of sexual acts between consenting LGBTQ+ adults, both in the U.S. and internationally. ADF has also supported state-sanctioned sterilization of trans individuals abroad and propagated unfounded claims, such as linking LGBTQ+ people to pedophilia. The organization alleges a \"homosexual agenda\" that it believes will destroy Christianity and society. ADF actively works on developing \"religious liberty\" legislation allowing denial of goods and services to LGBTQ+ individuals based on religious beliefs. Despite its controversial stance, the group has achieved special advisory status at the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization of American States. ADF's leadership has expressed anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments, with statements suggesting opposition to transgender rights, same-sex marriage, and the broader LGBTQ+ community. The organization has expanded its reach through various training programs, including the Blackstone Legal Fellowship, aiming to influence legal professionals and shape conservative Christian values in the legal sphere. Overall, the ADF's influence has grown significantly, playing a role in shaping the Trump administration's policies on LGBTQ+ rights.",

        "Description": "American Renaissance (AR or AmRen), a project of the Virginia-based New Century Foundation and founded by white nationalist Jared Taylor in 1990, is a white supremacist organization that presents itself as a scholarly forum challenging racial taboos while avoiding explicit racial slurs. The symbol of AmRen consists of two black and yellow circles that merge, with an ancient Greek or Roman column appearing in the center. Along the sides are the words \"American Renaissance.\" Operating through its now defunct magazine and website, the organization promotes pseudoscientific studies and research that assert the alleged inferiority of Black people and Latino immigrants compared to white people. Despite its seemingly academic facade, American Renaissance openly espouses white nationalism and eugenics, arguing for a \"self-consciously European, majority-white nation.\" The magazine has been known to publish controversial articles on topics like eugenics, with notable instances including claims of racial disparities in psychopathic personality traits. American Renaissance hosts biannual conferences that attract a diverse range of participants from the racist right, including neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Holocaust deniers, many from overseas. The group has faced internal tensions, notably in 2006 when a public dispute erupted over antisemitism during a conference. Although Jared Taylor has attempted to distance the organization from overt antisemitism, maintaining internal unity has proven challenging. In 2013, American Renaissance transitioned to an entirely electronic format and increased the frequency of its conferences, featuring extreme discussions about the establishment of a white homeland and concerns about declining white population percentages. The group's controversial views continue to be a source of contention, with some former members renouncing their racist beliefs.",

The logo of C14 consists of a black and white image of two men looking towards the right-hand side of the image with a sphere underneath. The man on the left has a long mustache and a single strand of hair, while the second is bald with a black face mask. \"C14\" appears in between the men and the sphere. The organization's emblem, featuring the number 14, is considered a hate symbol, drawing connections to the \"14 Words\" slogan penned by American white supremacist terrrorist David Lane. It is also likely that \"14\" is a reference to Adolf Hitler as the first letters of his first and last name are the first (\u0410) and fourth letters (\u0413) in the Ukrainian alphabet.",

The Carillon Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur flag, originating in 1903 in Saint-Jude, Quebec, has its roots in the Battle of Fort Carillon during the French and Indian War. In this battle, the French, led by General Montcalm, achieved victory against a much larger British force. In 1902, inspired by the Carillon flag, Priest Elph\u00e8ge Filiatrault created a version featuring four fleurs-de-lis and a white cross on an azure background. The following year, a committee added the Sacred Heart to the design. Recognized by the Quebec government in 1926, it became the flag of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Jean-Baptiste. Combining nationalism and religious symbolism, it was used by French Catholic nationalists from 1903 to 1935. While not inherently hateful, it is employed by contemporary ultra-nationalist and traditionalist Catholic groups in Quebec today. The flag remains part of Quebec's historical narrative and is used by various civil society institutions today, thus contextual interpretation is crucial when assessing its usage.",

While significant for fundamentalist far-right Christians and depending on context used completely legitimately, this symbol is not widely recognized, with the sacred heart often taking precedence in places like France. For fundamentalists, the Chrism also serves as a marker of opposition to neopagan currents originating from the V\u00f6lkisch movement. But the symbol has also been adopted by far-right activists. It is frequently seen in France, where it is used by Christian nationalists, and in Eastern Europe, where the symbol has been associated with the Obraz movement in Serbia and Russia.",

Starting in the early 2000s, he pushed anti-imperialist positions within the German radical left.

Since 2015, COMPACT has served as the mouthpiece of the far-right political party Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the anti-Muslim PEGIDA movement.",

The flag is used widely by racists and white nationalists in the U.S., particularly groups in the Neo-Confederate movement that valorize the Souther side. It contains a blue \"X\" on a red background with 13 stars representing each of the states of the Confederacy, plus one. The cross is a St. James cross. The battle flag has spread to many other countries as a symbol for racialist groups and even soccer hooligans in the Balkans.",

Essentially, it seeks to undermine efforts made by settler societies to reconcile with their colonial past by endorsing white nationalist interpretations of history.

The slogan has also been used by the National Socialist Network in Australia during celebrations of Australia Day.",

The images usually contrast these images with the language that this is how a multicultural society is being \"cultural enriched.\" The idea is to mock multicultural tenants of diversity as bringing violence to societies. These racist memes are very frequently found on social media platforms frequented by white supremacists, such as 4chan. Foreigners and POC are often referred to as \"cultural enrichers\" by the far right as a reference to this meme.",

The meme began in 2011 on 4chan with the first iteration being \"Hitler did nothing wrong.\" Since then, other figures have been added to the list of individuals included in the phrase such as former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who used death squads against his opponents, a phrase worn by Patriot Prayer principal Tusitala \u201cTiny\u201d Toese. This meme has become so widespread that it is not exclusively used by racists anymore, so context is key to identifying hateful usage of it.",

Under its then-chairman Adolf von Thadden, the party won nearly 10 percent of the vote in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, but, in 1969, it failed to pass the five percent bar to get into the federal parliament. For the next 25 years, the party suffered constant infighting and decline. In the mid-1990s, the NPD began to accept openly neo-Nazi members, and from 1998 onward, under then-Chairman Udo Voigt, who has been charged twice for incitement for distributing racist materials, it began again to increase its vote share, particularly in Eastern Germany.",

The symbol of the FIB consists of the Integralist Sigma on a white circle, on top of a blue background. Next to it is the Brazilian integralist slogan \"Deus, p\u00e1tria e fam\u00edlia\" (God, Country, and Family). The FIB views itself as a reincarnation of the earlier Integralist movement established by Plinio Salgado in the 1930s, charged with rescuing the cultural, political and ideological heritage of Salgado\u2019s movement. After Salgado passed away in 1975, a series of attempts to revive his movement failed. But in 2004, the First Integralist Congress for the 21st century was held in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. At the congress, the idea of FIB emerged, though it was originally called the Brazilian Integralist Movement (MIB). In 2005, FIB was officially established through the union of various Integralist associations that had been functioning autonomously. As of 2023, Moises Lima is the  president of the Brazilian Integralist Front (FIB). He is a political consultant affiliated with the PTB (Brazilian Party).",

It eventually evolved into a political party with the aim of federating the nationalist-revolutionary and various far-right groups orphaned from Salazarism. The logo of the Frente Nacional consisted of the initials \"FN\" in black font forming what resembles a wolfsangel, on top of a bi-color green and red flag in the background. The origins of the Frente Nacional trace back to April 1976 when the weekly A Rua was established, driven by Manuel Maria M\u00farias, a journalist associated with the Estado Novo regime. A Rua became a prominent voice of the Portuguese far-right over its four-year existence. The magazine served as a focal point for discussions on strategies to reunite the far-right and create a broad front.",

The number \"1143\" represents the year that Portugal was founded by D. Afonso Henriques and the beginning of the Reconquista against the Moors, and is used by some on the Portuguese far right to assert the homogeneity of the Portuguese people. The name Grupo 1143 (Group 1143) is the same as a neo-Nazi football hooligan club that Machado also led from around 2001 to 2015 and that served as a recruitment pool for the Portuguese Hammerskins.",

The book is a work of speculative fiction that has sparked considerable controversy and debate due to its themes and portrayal of immigration, and has gone on to influence the narratives of the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory. The Camp of the Saints tells the story of a massive immigration crisis that begins when a fleet of impoverished people from the Global South, seemingly India, sets sail for the shores of France. The novel portrays these immigrants as poor, desperate, and driven by the hope of a better life in the West. As the fleet approaches the French coast, the French government and society grapple with how to respond to the impending arrival of millions of migrants. The novel depicts the breakdown of societal norms, the rise of far-right and anti-immigrant sentiments, and the ultimate surrender of France to the migrants, who overrun the country. The novel explores the fear and paranoia surrounding immigration, portraying the migrants as a faceless and threatening \"Other\" who evoke anxiety and xenophobia among the French population. The Camp of the Saints suggests that Western societies are incapable of resisting mass immigration, leading to their eventual downfall and destruction.",

The \"Love Jihad\" theory is based on prejudice and anti-Muslim beliefs, as it perpetuates negative stereotypes about Muslim communities. In some Indian states, there have been calls for laws to counter what proponents of the conspiracy theory believe to be a real phenomenon.

Above the shield is a silver star, and below it is a banner with the words \"Pro Brasilia Fiant Eximia\" (For Brazil, Be Exceptional). It is racist, believing in the ethnic superiority of those living in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. This is in comparison to other parts of the country that have larger Black populations, which on social media they constantly point out are poorer areas of the country. With Nascimento Franco\u2019s death in 2007, the MSPI appeared to fall apart, with its supporters leaving, abandoning militancy or supporting other groups through the internet, such as the Movimento Rep\u00fablica de S\u00e3o Paulo (MRSP). MSPI was relaunched in 2013 by J\u00falio C\u00e9sar Bueno, who declared that the state should forbid migrants from other regions moving there.",

In addition to playing at music festivals and touring, NSBM bands are known for their open promotion fascist and neo-Naziism. For example, the band Infernal War, previously known as Infernal SS, has been associated with Nazi imagery and references.

Members of the group have made racist, antisemitic, anti-LGBTQ+ and other bigoted statements. They have also often repeated the white supremacist \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory.",

It is made by creating a circle with the thumb and pointer finger, with the other three fingers pointed outwards. In 2017, the unregulated and extremism-filled forum 4chan launched a campaign to trick the media into thinking it was a white supremacist symbol. This led to actual white supremacists using the symbol to signify to others their support for white supremacist causes. MAGA supporters have also used the hand sign as a way to \"trigger\" liberals. Online, the OK signal is also frequently used as an emoticon.",

In its later eras, the Klan also targeted Jews, Catholics and immigrants, and was particularly violent during America's Civil Rights Movement, where Klan members violently attacked protesters favoring equal rights. Sometimes, Klan outfits can be in other colors including red, orange, or black to signify a leadership position in the organization. The uniform of the Ku Klux Klan was used to strike fear into those they attacked, often ex-slaves in the late 1800s, during terror campaigns. They are also worn during Klan demonstrations and cross-burnings both to intimidate and to keep their identities hidden.",

However, it has become associated with white supremacist hate music, particularly in the genres of Oi! or \"hatecore\" punk. The symbol of RAC consists of a red hammer and sickle, representing communism, with a white skull biting down on the hammer. The words \"Rock Against Communism\" can be found above and below the image. The term \"Rock Against Communism\" serves as a euphemism for this genre, which often features lyrics promoting antisemitism, racism, and National Socialism (Nazism), and rarely refers to \"communism\" itself, a term that neo-Nazis often associate instead with multiculturalism and \"Jewish control\" of institutions of power. RAC concerts are organized multiple times a year, and the movement has expanded beyond music, with white supremacists appropriating the \"Rock Against\u2026\" phrase for various other contexts, such as \"Rock Against Coronavirus\" and \"Rock Against Islam.\" Pugilato NSHC (National Socialist Hardcore) is cited as an example of a Spanish white supremacist band associated with the RAC genre. Other RAC bands include Kushfrost and 13 Knots.",

It consists of three horizontal stripes: black at the top, yellow in the middle, and white at the bottom. The flag was used as the state and naval ensign of the Russian Empire from the late 17th century until the overthrow of the monarchy during the Russian Revolution in 1917. The black-yellow-white color scheme of the flag has deep historical significance. The black stripe represents the Romanov dynasty, the ruling family of the Russian Empire. The yellow stripe symbolizes the wealth and prosperity of the nation, while the white stripe signifies the Russian Orthodox Church and purity. In modern times, the Russian Imperial Flag has been adopted by various groups, both within Russia and among Russian expatriates, as a symbol of nostalgia for the imperial era and as a statement against the Soviet and post-Soviet governments. In the modern era, various far-right and extremist groups have adopted the Russian Imperial Flag as their symbol.",

Context is very important here as saffron doesn't necessarily imply being against other communities given its long historical association with Hinduism, which is not generally a discriminatory religion. Only when the color is used in contexts that promote Hindu supremacy, should it be seen as a far-right symbol.",

In the movement's eyes: \"the symbol reminds us that our movement has the meaning of integrating all the social forces of the country in the supreme expression of nationality, hence, our struggle to implant the Integral State.\" It has been used by such groups as Pl\u00ednio Salgado's original integralist movement, the A\u00e7\u00e3o Integralista Brasileira (Brazilian Integralist Action, AIB) in the 1930s, and more recently by modern Integralist movements of the 2020s including the A\u00e7\u00e3o Integralista Revolucion\u00e1ria (Revolutionary Integralist Action), the Movimento Linearista Integralista Brasileiro (Brazilian Integralist Linearist Movement), and the Frente Integralista Brasileira (Brazilian Integralist Front).

Today, it is the most recognizable symbols of Nazism and support for Hitler and the Nazi regime's genocidal beliefs. The symbol is essentially a cross with arms that all extend either clockwise or counter-clockwise, giving the symbol the appearance of rotating. In non-racist contexts, it is also used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in certain religions from the Indian subcontinent, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, so context is important when identifying a racist interpretation of its usage.",

        "Description": "\"Technological Slavery: The Collected Writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, a.k.a. 'The Unabomber'\" is a collection of writings by Theodore Kaczynski, an American mathematician and former professor who became infamous as the Unabomber. Kaczynski led a nationwide bombing campaign against people involved with modern technology, resulting in three deaths and numerous injuries. The book delves into Kaczynski's critique of industrial-technological society, arguing that the development and implementation of advanced technologies lead to the erosion of human freedom and autonomy. Kaczynski advocates for a return to a simpler, pre-industrial way of life to counteract what he sees as the dehumanizing and enslaving effects of modern technology. Though more popular among extreme left ecologists and animal rights activists who reject modern society and technology, Kaczynski's writings have also become influential on the eco-fascist sections of the far right, including the perpetrator of the far-right terrorist attack in Buffalo, New York, who self-identified as an \"eco-fascist,\" and plagiarized sections on environmentalism that framed immigration as \"environmental warfare\" for his manifesto. Many of the ideas originally laid out by Ted Kaczynski were appropriated by contemporary eco-fascist subcultures, and despite his disavowal of eco-fascism, his anti-modern and anti-technology views resonate in these communities.",

His approach, as described by Anglin himself, involves desensitizing readers, particularly white males aged 10 to 30, to extremist ideas. The website gained notoriety for its role in coordinating harassment campaigns against individuals and groups deemed enemies by Anglin. The followers, known as the \"Stormer Troll Army\" or \"Stormers,\" engage in online harassment, often at Anglin's encouragement. They use the website's forum to organize and coordinate activities, including the spread of disinformation, attacks on social media, and trolling efforts. The coordinated campaigns targeted women, Black people, Jews, Muslims, and others, employing various tactics to spread false information and create online chaos.",

Traditional Catholicism is a strain of the Catholic religion that adheres to the Latin Catholic mass and other rituals that were reformed by the Church through the Second Vatican Council, which began in 1962. Most Traditionalist Catholics aren't connected to extremist beliefs, but a subset, particularly those identifying as Radical Traditionalist Catholics, have rejected changes to antisemitic aspects of the pre-Council liturgy. Traditional Catholicism is also a growing trend among racialist groups, as is identification with the Orthodox religion, who often create their own interpretations of the concept.",

In essence, Salazar considered that the \"Nation\" was an objective reality made up of hierarchies originating from \"natural differences\" between people. Despite these differences in personal interests, however, Salazar believed that with the subordination of individuals to the interests of \"the nation,\" arbitrarily defined by Salazar and other nationalists, the perceived problems of social and economic liberalism could be solved.",

        "Description": "VDARE, founded in 1999 by Peter Brimelow, is an anti-immigrant and white nationalist website that portrays itself as an advocate for civic nationalism focusing on immigration issues. However, it has garnered attention and criticism for its associations with white nationalism. The VDARE logo consists of the white doe, a reference to Virginia Dare, the first child born to English settlers in the New World, next to the word \"VDARE.com.\" VDARE is noteable for its role in bridging mainstream anti-immigrant sentiments with the white nationalist fringe. Prominent contributors, including Jared Taylor and Jason Kessler, have expressed controversial views on race and immigration, while figures such as Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, and Pat Buchanan have also contributed to the site. The VDARE Foundation, the organization's umbrella group, received a substantial donation from the right-wing DonorsTrust in 2019 and VDARE's ties to the mainstream conservative movement are evident through appearances at events like CPAC. The group's proximity to the Trump administration, with individuals associated seeking positions, and Stephen Miller inviting Brimelow to speak in 2007, underscores its influence in Trumpian political circles.",
