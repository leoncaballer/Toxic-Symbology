Originally intending to achieve global sustainable development by the year 2000, the \"21\" in Agenda 21 reflects the target of the 21st century. The initiative encourages local, national, and global voluntary actions by the UN, multilateral organizations, and individual governments. However, various conspiracy theories have emerged regarding Agenda 21, particularly among American antigovernment and militia organizations and far-right activists. The \"Agenda 21\" conspiracy theory is a baseless and widely debunked narrative that falsely claims a secret global plot to establish a New World Order and control individuals' lives through environmental regulations. The right-wing John Birch Society labeled it as a disguised plot to curtail individual freedom and establish a one-world government. Some activists, including elements of the American Tea Party movement, propagated the theory that Agenda 21 aimed to undermine property rights, U.S. sovereignty, or coerce citizens into relocating to urban areas. Far-right American media personality Glenn Beck went further, warning of a \"seditious\" conspiracy to reduce the world population by 85 percent, leading to global government control and a dystopian police state, as detailed in his co-authored 2012 Agenda 21.",

The racist connotations come when the topic of immigration is introduced; racists often refer to individuals that are open to the idea of non-white immigration as \"cucks\" in an effort to portray immigrants as being invasive and threatening to the \"purity\" of white women and the white gene pool. The term \"cuckservative\" was created specifically to refer to conservatives perceived to be too open to immigration and not sympathetic to white nationalist causes.",
